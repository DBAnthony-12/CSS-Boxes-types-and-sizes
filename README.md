Understanding “type” in CSS primarily involves understanding the role of typography in web design and how CSS can be used to control it. The style, organization, and look of text are all included in CSS typography, which enables programmers to produce readable and aesthetically pleasing material. 

There are 2 types of categorized fonts:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Serif: 
Sans serif: 

Serif fonts have small lines at the end of letters called serif. Letters were never precisely aligned when they were manually positioned on a printing press. The text was simpler to read because of the serifs that connected the letters. 

On the other hand, sans serif fonts are more contemporary in style and lack serifs. Sans serif fonts are primarily utilized on the web for longer text when computer typesetting because they have a clean, readable appearance. 

Web fonts are a bit more complicated than print fonts because they depend on where the fonts came from. Understanding and effectively applying these aspects of type in CSS can significantly improve the useability, accessibility and overall aesthetics of a web page. 

Applying Type Formatting with CSS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Applying the formatting with CSS involves various properties to style and format text. Enhancing readability, aesthetics and user experience. Understanding and applying size in CSS is crucial for responsive design, ensuring content looks good on all devices. 

Font Family (Font-family): specifying the typeface. 

Font size (Font-size): determines the text size. 

Font weight (Font-weight): controls the thickness of text. 

Font style (Font-style): applies styles like italic or oblique. 

Line height (Line-height): adjust the space between lines of text. 

Text alignment (text-align): aligns text (left, right, centre, justify). 

Text decoration (text-decoration): adds decorations (underline, overline, line-through). 

Text transform (text-transform): controls text capitalization. 

Letter spacing(letter-spacing) and word-spacing(word-spacing): adjust the space between letters and words. 

Understanding and applying size in CSS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In CSS, size is and essential property that influences text, containers and spacing among other components. 

Units of measurements:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

CSS supports absolute units (px, pt, cm) and relative units (em, rem, %, vw, vh). Relative units are preferred for responsive design as they adjust based on other factors like parent element size or viewport dimensions. 

Font size is an important typographic feature that affects reading. For scalability, it can be set in relative units or pixels for a fixed size. 

Viewports units: vw (viewport width) and vh (viewport height) are useful for creating responsive designs that scale with the browser window. 

Media queries: allow the application of different styles based on the devoice characteristics, like width, height, or orientation. This is crucial for adjusting sizes on different screens.

Combining type formatting and size in CSS for responsive designs:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To effectively apply type formatting and size in CSS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use relative units for font sizes, margins and padding to ensure scalability and responsiveness. 

Employ media queries to adjust text sizes and layout components based on viewport dimensions. 

Leverage viewport units for some design element to make them responsive to the screen size. 

Prioritize readability and accessibility ensuring text remains legible and beautifully formatted across devices. 

These techniques can be combined to produce web pages that are robust in terms of functionality and design, offering a smooth user experience on every device or screen size. 

Understanding the box model in CSS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding the CSS box model and working with its components, border, padding and margin are fundamentals to mastering layout and styling in web design. A fundamental idea known as the "box model" explains how each element on a web page is represented as a rectangular box with padding, borders, margins, and content inside of it. 

Border:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Border properties are set with width, height, style and colour elements border. 

Padding: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Padding sets the spacing properties between the content of its border. 
Padding can be specified for each side of the elements individually. 

Margin: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sets the property of spacing between an element’s border and adjustment elements. 
Like padding, margin can be specified for each element individually or as a shorthand for all slides.
